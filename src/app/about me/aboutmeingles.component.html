    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a Full Stack web developer with a background in chemical engineering, I have a broad range of technical and creative skills to effectively tackle complex problems. At just 25 years old, I decided to switch careers to programming because I found a passion and constant challenge in it. Through my education and work experience, I have developed skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and the ability to quickly and efficiently learn new technologies. Additionally, I have been involved in projects where I have utilized tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, GitHub, PHP, and SQL and NoSQL databases. </p>
